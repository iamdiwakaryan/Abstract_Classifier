# Abstract_Classifier
Developed a sophisticated machine learning model aimed at automating the classification of sentences within research paper abstracts into five distinct categories: "Background," "Objective," "Methodology," "Result," and "Conclusion."
Designed and implemented a hybrid model using a transformer, a character embedding model and a positional embedding model.
Universal Sentence Encoder v5 (from Tensorflow Hub) is used as a transformer in the model.
